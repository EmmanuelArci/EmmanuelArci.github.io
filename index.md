## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 3, part 1 

  This lab was very interesting because I did not know anything about the basal metabolic rate and it taught me something I can use to lose weight. This lab made us
  write a function definition that allows us to ask questions and retrieve answers as our information that we need. The program then calculated the BMR of a man or a woman
  with the data collected and different functions provided that are used for the calculation.

* Lab 4, part 1

  This is one of my favorite labs we did because the program is a program I could actually use personally by needing to convert different measurement units.
  This lab taught me to declare and initialize different double variables. I enjoy math, so I had a fun time creating a conversion calculator.

* Lab 8, part 2

  I had fun with this lab because we got the chance to create art with patterns. The lab dealt with using for loops, while loops, and do-while loops to create a pattern.
  I would have never thought you could create cool patterns with such simple code in a matter of a couple minutes.
